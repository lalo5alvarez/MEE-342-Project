Shaft Analysis
The expected inputs of the file include the ideal lengths of all three shafts, the youngs modulus, yeild strength, endurance limit, ultimate tensile strength, ideal factor of safety, the radi and width of all the gears and bearings, and the radial and tangential forces in between the gears and supports. From here the code will give the moment and torsion diagrams of the shaft. Later on, the code will ask you for an input for the concentration factors at the shoulders and key ways. From here the code will calulate the von mesis stress using the yield and factor of safetey, and using the input kf values it will calculate the goodman diameter and using this diameter it calculates kf until the values fall within 5% of eachother. The deflection is analyzed using finite element analysis, , and the fatigue analysis uses von mesisis  and other equations.
